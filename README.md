# Hi, I'm Austin
## About Me
1. I am a student, graduated from SLCC with my AS in Computer Science in May 2021.
2. I will be starting at Western Governer's University to pursue my Bachelor's degree and hopefully graduate by December 2025.
3. After that I hope to build a career for myself in software engineering, hopefully with Sean and/or Mason! Two of my best friends!

*have a wonderful day*
